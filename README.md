# Data_augmentation of medical images using diffusion vision transformers Diffi T

This project foucses on increasing the diversity of the choosen dataset (Chest CT scan), by producing augmented images using Diffi T model. Increasing the diversity in dataset, is expected to improve the performance of 
classifier models build on that dataset.
